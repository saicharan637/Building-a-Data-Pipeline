## Building-a-Data-Pipeline
Utilized Lambda Architecture and created a data pipeline on AWS to make analysis on a Permanent magnet synchronous motor(PMSM) dataset which is taken from Kaggle. The data of a PMSM machine is uploaded into an input source(S3 bucket) batch-wise and a lambda function is used as a trigger further operations and perform real time analysis as required using QuickSight. Examined the reading and inferred that all the parts of the motor are working synchronously and are in stable condition.
